# dice-game
Dice game program made using Pygame
This program allows the user to play a game where points are earned by rolling dice and correctly inputting the sum of the squares of the lengths of the runs that are rolled.
For example: if the dice are rolled and they show: 1,4,2,6,3,1,2 the roll consists of two runs: 1,2,3,4 and 1,2 the length of the runs: 4 and 2 so the score would be 4^2 + 2^2 = 20
